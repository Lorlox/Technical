        With the creation of the World Wide Web, home and business internet use is taking off. Now, more than ever, is a great time to get into the field of technology. Here's everything you need to know about becoming a self-taught Front End Developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Front End Web Development deals with the user interface side of websites and web apps. This involves creating a static site that is pleasing to the eye and easy for users to navigate.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Devs may use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and other programming languages to create static web pages for products, information, how-to's, and much more. Any website you can think of- including Facebook, Yahoo, and Wikipedia were created by web developers using these same skills!
        </li>
        <li>
          Since the internet is still relatively new, it is entirely possible to learn the skills on your own. If you can demonstrate a mastery of web development, utilize a portfolio of completed projects, and successfully show that you can do the job, you too can work as a Front End Developer.

      <p>Front Stack Developers should have a good grasp of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        HTML- Hyper Text Markup Language, which is what web browsers compute to display the layout of a web page
        </li>
        <li> CSS- Cascading Style Sheet. This is what styles and formats a web page</li>
        <li>
          Javascript- a commonly used programming language that is used to create interactive effects within web browsers
        </li>
      </ul>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="What_is_HTML">
    <header>What is HTML</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        HTML- which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language- is a set of instructions given so that web browsers know what content to display on the the web page. HTML is the general outline, and all words that are displayed on the web page or app are deployed by HTML.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML consists of values, properties, tags, elements, and much more. For example, the opening tag 'p' wrapped by angle brackets, denotes the start of a paragraph. The angle brackets indicate an opening tag, while the 'p' indicates a paragraph. 
      </p>

      <p> 
        Here are some examples
        <code> <p> paragraph </p></code> <code> <article>article</article></code> <code><em> emphasis text</em></code> 
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is often likened to a two dimensional newspaper. It has the words, spacing, borders and divisions, and all readable content, but it is still basic when compared to the styling and effects that CSS can provide. 
      </p>
    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="What_is_CSS">
    <header>What is CSS</header>
    <article>
    <p>
      CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheet, gives directions to the browser to style the content in HTML. It is called "Cascading" because it follows a general rule that whatever is typed last overrides whatever is written before, in reference to rules. There are exceptions of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      With CSS, we may define sizes, colors, fonts. We can even make animations with CSS! CSS is what brings HTML content to life and makes it vibrant, interactive, and something closer to three-dimensional.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some examples
      <code> font-weight: 50;</code> <code> margin: auto;</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS may also utilize Bootstrap, which is a pre-set of commonly used rules and outlines that makes it easier than creating your own styles from scratch. Similarly, FlexBox may also be used as a preset to create certain types of wrapping, grids, columns and rows, among many other styling elements.
    </p>

      <p>
        Javascript is a free-form programming language that is very useful in Front End Web Development. With a series of functions and declarations, it gives web browsers a more rounded, in depth set of instructions to help make the most out of your web pages and apps.

        Web Development isn't for everyone. It takes a lot of time, dedication and practice. But it is a worthwhile and very in-demand skillset to learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that you've learned the basic requirements of Front End Web Development, you can begin your learning journey.
